description: "Public and witness declarations in circuits."

Every circuit needs explicit input declarations. These tell the compiler which variables are **public** (visible to the verifier) and which are **witness** (known only to the prover).

## Scalar Declarations

Declare one variable at a time:

```ach
public output
witness secret
```

Or multiple on one line, separated by commas:

```ach
public x, y
witness a, b, c
```

Public inputs become part of the proof's public statement — anyone verifying the proof can see their values. Witness inputs remain private to the prover.

## Array Declarations

Declare a fixed-size array of inputs with bracket syntax:

```ach
witness path[3]
witness indices[3]
```

This creates three indexed variables (`path_0`, `path_1`, `path_2`) that you access with standard indexing. Array declarations work for both public and witness inputs:

```ach
public commitments[4]
witness secrets[4]
```

## Using Declared Inputs

Once declared, inputs are ordinary variables. Use them in expressions, pass them to builtins, and index into arrays:

```ach
public output
witness a
witness b

let product = a * b
assert_eq(product, output)

let sum = a + b
assert_eq(sum, a + b)
```

Array elements are accessed by index:

```ach
public expected_sum
witness vals[3]

let acc = vals[0]
let acc = acc + vals[1]
let acc = acc + vals[2]
assert_eq(acc, expected_sum)
```

## CLI Alternative

Instead of in-source declarations, you can declare inputs with CLI flags:

```bash
ach circuit program.ach --public output --witness a,b --inputs "a=3,b=5,output=15"
```

The `--public` and `--witness` flags accept comma-separated variable names. If the source file already contains `public`/`witness` declarations, omit the flags — the compiler picks them up automatically.

Array inputs are passed with indexed names:

```bash
ach circuit merkle.ach --inputs "root=123,leaf=42,path_0=99,path_1=77,indices_0=0,indices_1=1"
```

## Type Annotations

Declarations can include optional type annotations. See [Type Annotations](/circuits/type-annotations/) for details.

```ach
public root: Field
witness flag: Bool
witness path[3]: Field
witness indices[3]: Bool
```

Annotating a witness as `Bool` saves 1 constraint by skipping boolean enforcement.

## Errors

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `DuplicateInput` | Same name declared as both `public` and `witness`, or declared twice |
| `UndeclaredVariable` | Using a variable that was never declared as `public` or `witness` |
| `AnnotationMismatch` | Declared type doesn't match the inferred type |
