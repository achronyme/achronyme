A **field element** is a number in the BN254 scalar field — integers modulo the prime:

```
p = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617
```

All arithmetic on field elements is **modular**: addition, subtraction, and multiplication wrap around at `p`, and division computes the modular inverse.

## Int vs Field

| | Int | Field |
|---|---|---|
| Range | -2^59 to 2^59-1 | 0 to p-1 |
| Overflow | Runtime error | Wraps modulo p |
| Negation | `-x` | `p - x` |
| Division | Truncating (`7 / 2 = 3`) | Modular inverse (`1/2 = (p+1)/2`) |
| Storage | Inline (60-bit tagged) | Heap-allocated (256-bit Montgomery) |

Int and Field are **distinct types**. Mixing them in arithmetic is a runtime error:

```
0p3 + 5       // Error: Cannot mix Int and Field
0p3 + 0p5     // OK: 0p8
```

## Creating Field Elements

Use the `0p` prefix to create field elements. It works like `0x` for hex:

```
let a = 0p42         // decimal field literal
let b = 0pxFF        // hex field literal (0px prefix)
let c = 0pb1010      // binary field literal (0pb prefix)
let d = 0p12345      // large decimal
```

## Arithmetic

Field elements support `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and `==`:

```
let a = 0p10
let b = 0p3

let sum  = a + b        // 0p13
let diff = a - b        // 0p7
let prod = a * b        // 0p30
let quot = a / b        // modular inverse of 3, times 10
let pow  = a ^ 5        // 10^5 mod p

// Negative exponents compute modular inverse
let inv = a ^ -1        // same as 0p1 / a
```

## In Circuits

In circuit mode (`prove {}` blocks and `circuit` CLI), **all values are field elements** implicitly. Integer variables captured by a `prove {}` block are converted to field elements automatically:

```
let x = 42
prove {
    // x is automatically converted to 0p42 inside the circuit
    public x
    assert_eq(x, 42)
}
```

This is the only place where Int→Field conversion happens implicitly. In regular VM execution, the conversion must always be explicit via `0p` field literals.
